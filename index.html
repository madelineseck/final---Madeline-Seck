                        The University of Maryland hosted events throughout October for Domestic Violence Awareness
                        Month, bringing attention to relationship violence and power-based violence that occurs on and

                        survey.

                        Elijah Foster, a junior public policy major, is part of the Violence Intervention program with
                        CARE, which educates individuals with the skills and tools to help prevent or safely intervene
                        if they witness sexual misconduct and any form of harm.

                    <br />
                    <p>
                        “At the start of the semester, I lost a friend to domestic violence,” Foster said, “and when it
                        happened . . . [I was] wondering, was there anything I could have done. Foster shared that,
                        “though I couldn’t have done anything at the time, I want to be able to be a resource. Men can
                        be a resource in this fight against domestic violence.”

                        “It's important to talk about the dynamics that exist on college campuses within relationships,
                        and how to support people that are impacted by relationship violence, and how to talk about
                        these issues,” said Charlotte Sheffield, an assistant coordinator for CARE.

                        message of the impact that sexual relationship violence has on the community so that maybe
                        people who have fortunately not experienced the issue, can still understand how big an impact it
                        has,” Boudreau said.
